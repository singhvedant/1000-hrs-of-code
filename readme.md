# 1000 Hours of code 
This is my journey at perfecting my self. I have got a job kinda thing that trains me so I am tracking it here in github.
Lets GOO!!
## DAY 1
Basic Linux Commands

## DAY 2
0. Compiler and Interpreter
Compiler compiles the whole program into machine code and then executes
Interpreter reads and runs the code line by line

1. Shell scripting :
.sh files are used to write scripts in shell
We can use arthematics, loops, if-else. Many things like normal programming for flow control and data control.

2. Variables : 
Containers for values
Name should be Noun (Naming Conventions)
hello starting with small letters(camelCase)
"$" is used to refer to the variables

3. Make a Tic-tac-toe game in Shell Script

## DAY 3
1. Git
- VCS - version control system, manages the changes to code in repository
- Git add (.) : Staging the files for github repository (dot to stage all the files at once)
- Git commit -m "commit message here" : storing the staged files in local repo
- Git stash : Stores the changes temporarily in local repo so we can change the repo and work on other issues and come back later.
- Git push : Updates the commits in local repository to remote repository
- Git -b "branch_name" : Create a branch
- Git checkout : change a branch if used -b then can create a new branch and change at the same time
- (-M) flag can be used to change the master branch
- init->-M main->checkout->do_Changes->add->commit->push-to-branch->checkout main->merge->push-to-main
