# 1000 Hours of code 
This is my journey at perfecting my self. I have got a job kinda thing that trains me so I am tracking it here in github.
Lets GOO!!
## DAY 1
Basic Linux Commands

## DAY 2
0. Compiler and Interpreter
Compiler compiles the whole program into machine code and then executes
Interpreter reads and runs the code line by line

1. Shell scripting :
.sh files are used to write scripts in shell
We can use arthematics, loops, if-else. Many things like normal programming for flow control and data control.

2. Variables : 
Containers for values
Name should be Noun (Naming Conventions)
hello starting with small letters(camelCase)
"$" is used to refer to the variables

3. Make a Tic-tac-toe game in Shell Script
